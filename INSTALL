Installation instructions:

You will need python3 and npm on your system

From web folder:
```
npm install
npm run build
```

From main folder:
```
python3 -m venv server-env
source server-env/bin/activate
pip install flask
deactivate
```


Note: I may have messed a bit the npm package,
so it will probably create a node_modules folder outside
your downloaded directory. Sorry for that.
I will fix it as soon as I will have time to investigate.
